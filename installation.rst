Installation
==========================================

**chapi** is available from `CCP4 version 9.0 <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/index.php#os=macos>`_ as a module in ccp4-python (Python 3.9.18)

To install the latest chapi library:

* Download the **build-it-3-3** script:

  https://github.com/pemsley/coot/blob/main/build-it-3-3


* Set this environment variable::

   export CHAPI_ONLY=true

* Run::

   bash build-it-3-3

It will run through the dependencies and hopefully end up with a Python that has the latest chapi.
There will be some screen output and build logs will be in ~/public_html/build_logs.
